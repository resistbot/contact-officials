# Contact Officials

Configuration files used by Resistbot to contact state and federal officials with their web forms.

The focus right now is on writing web form configs for 1) governors and
2) state legislative bodies which offer consistent contact forms for all
members. These forms are as interoperable as possible with the
[unitedstates/contact-congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress)
schema (i.e. Phantom of DC).

## Want to contribute? Help people write to their governors!

The document [*Teach Resistbot to send a message to a US Governor*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAXWDPfISgRY_qESNGzfT4tFKFaDF3PPUPLK_vZI4Bs)
walks you through the steps to contribute a new `governor.yaml` to this repo.

Resistbot lets any American easily write a message to their governor. After you
[teach Resistbot to use a governor’s official web contact form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAXWDPfISgRY_qESNGzfT4tFKFaDF3PPUPLK_vZI4Bs)
by writing a new `governor.yaml`, Resistbot will be able to deliver
messages immediately to that governor. You'll have made it faster and
easier for everybody to be heard in local politics.

## Directory and file structure

```
- states
  - CA
    * upper.yaml  # form config that applies for all members of California State Senate
    * lower.yaml  # for all members of California State Assembly
    * governor.yaml  # for CA governor
    * CAL000501.yaml  # e.g. if we want to use different form config for Sen. de León than other CA senators

  - TX
    * upper.yaml  # for all members of Texas State Senate
    * lower.yaml  # for all members of Texas State House of Representatives

  ... directories for other states ...

- congress
  * P000603.yaml  # for Rand Paul, Resistbot uses this intead of contact-congress/P000603.yaml
  ... configs for other Members of Congress for whom Resistbot has its own setup ...

- whitehouse
  * president.yml  # for the White House
  ... configs for other federal executives with web forms, as Resistbot adds support ...
```

Notes:

- Bio IDs come from Biographical Directory of the United States Congress
  and from Open States.

- `upper` and `lower` correspond to values that `chamber`/`post.label` takes in Open States.

- We will keep `congress` directory as sparse as possible, strongly
  preferring to make changes upstream and defer to the config in `contact-congress`.

## Schema

Schema is based on [that of unitedstates/contact-congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress/blob/master/documentation/schema.md) with these changes:

* New variables `PHONE_AREA_CODE`, `PHONE_DIGITS_ONLY`, `PHONE3`, `PHONE4`, `PHONE7`, `NAME_FULL`, `NAME_PREFIX_NO_PERIOD`, `ADDRESS_STREET_CITY_STATE`, `ADDRESS_FULL`.

* `bioguide`, `contact_form.method`, and `contact_form.action` are optional.

* In `fill_in` steps, `captcha_selector` can be an element enclosing text.
  The processor should strip non-word characters from beginning and end of this element's `textContent`,
  append `captcha_append_guidance` if present, and then submit this for textual
  captcha solving. See `states/FL/upper.yaml` for an example.

* In `fill_in` steps with image captchas, `captcha_image_extension` can
  optionally specify filename extension of the image, for example `png`. This
  is necessary to use if the `src` of the `img` element does not have an image
  format extension, which 2captcha requires. See `states/SC/upper.yaml`
  for an example.

* In `success` section, instead of `body`, one can specify text that
  must match an alert. See `states/WA/governor.yaml` for an example.

* Introduction of meta variables, described below.

## Meta variables

Collectively, state legislatures are huge. Let’s look at the three most populous states plus Ohio. These are the largest states that offer web contact forms for their legislators.

* CA: 40 senators, 80 assemblymembers
* TX: 31 senators, 150 representatives
* FL: 40 senators, 120 representatives
* OH: 33 senators, 99 representatives

If we use one form config per bioguide, that’s 593 form config files. Moreover, if perhaps 20% of officials churn in an election cycle, that’s about 100 form config files we need to delete and 100 form config files we need to add. Worse, because the contact forms for these states’ representatives are maintained by the state, if a contact form changes, we need to update tens or hundreds of config files at once.

So it would be expedient if we can, in states with consistent forms per chamber, set up state form config files that can be used for every member of the chamber. We wouldn’t need to do anything to handle churn, since we are not hard-coding bioguides anywhere. If a contact form changes, we need to update only one config file.

Let's make it possible for form configs to reference dynamically an individual district or URL.

We introduce notion of “meta variable”, and make it possible to include `$META_VARIABLES` anywhere in the document. They will simply be replaced with the value of the variable, i.e. `config.replace('$META_OFFICIAL_DISTRICT_ZFILL', '07')`. The context must take care of quoting, if necessary.

For example, the CA senator config starts with:
```
- visit: "https://lcmspubcontact.lc.ca.gov/PublicLCMS/ContactPopup.php?district=SD$META_OFFICIAL_DISTRICT_ZFILL"
```
and the CA representative config with:
```
- visit: "https://lcmspubcontact.lc.ca.gov/PublicLCMS/ContactPopup.php?district=AD$META_OFFICIAL_DISTRICT_ZFILL"
```
The config for OH senate starts with:
```
- visit: "$META_OFFICIAL_URL"
```

Config files in `contact-officials` assume meta variables defined as
follows:

- `$META_OFFICIAL_DISTRICT`: The district of the official, or empty
    string if official holds statewide office. This corresponds to
    `district` in Open States and theunitedstates.io Congress data.

- `$META_OFFICIAL_DISTRICT_ZFILL`: District normalized such that
    single-digit district names get a leading zero, e.g. "07".

- `$META_OFFICIAL_URL`: The URL of the official homepage of the
    official. This corresponds to `url` in Open States and `url` in
    theunitedstates.io Congress data.

- `$META_OFFICIAL_LAST_SEGMENT_OF_URL`: Everything after the last slash
    in the official's URL. One can't directly visit a NJ state
    legislator's URL (e.g.
    http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=47) directly without
    being served a redirect! The only way to get to such a URL is by
    clicking on a link from e.g. the roster, which sets some server-side
    session state. This meta variable helps click on the legislator's
    link from the roster.

- `$META_OFFICIAL_STATE_LEGISLATOR_INDEX`: The index (1-indexed) of the
    official in list of the chamber legislators by alphabetical order by
    last name of state lower chamber legislators in alphabetical name.
    Even after visiting a NJ legislator's personal webpage, and clicking
    contact link, one is taken to a page that lists a district's 1 senator
    and 2 representatives, with checkboxes for each. For assemblymembers,
    the only way we can select the right checkbox here is to introduce
    this meta variable which identifies the legislator's index in this list,
    1-indexed.

- `$META_OFFICIAL_FIRST_NAME`: First name of official.

- `$META_OFFICIAL_LAST_NAME`: Last name of official.
