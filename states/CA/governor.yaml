# Selecting "Have Comment" on the first page results in a different second page depending on the subject selection:
# - Most second pages will have a "Pro / Con" radio selection.
# - Selecting "OTHER" topic presents a "subject field".
# - Selecting "Scheduling - Request" presents an entirely different page with many options.

# Selecting "Request for Help" on the first page results in a consistent second page
# regardless of the topic chosen on the first page. In the config, we are
# simply choosing "OTHER". The second page also includes constituent name and
# address when "need help" is selected.

# Technical Detail:
# This form is implemented in React, so it's much more complicated to fiddle with the form.
# We need to rely on `click` rather than editing form element values (there actually is no `form` here)
# To inspect the dorpdowns, you need to delete the `focusout` events from the top-level container div
# for each dropdown you need to inspect. Chrome can do this, it's not clear firefox can.
# This will stop the dropdown from closing when you try to inspect the sub-elements.
