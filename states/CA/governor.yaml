# Selecting "Have Comment" on the first page results in a different second page depending on the subject selection:
# - Most second pages will have a "Pro / Con" radio selection.
# - Selecting "OTHER" topic presents a "subject field".
# - Selecting "Scheduling - Request" presents an entirely different page with many options.

# Selecting "Need Help" on the first page results in a consistent second page
# regardless of the topic chosen on the first page. In the config, we are
# simply choosing "OTHER". The second page also includes constituent name and
# address when "need help" is selected.
